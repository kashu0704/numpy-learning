# 🔢 NumPy Learning Journey

Welcome to my **NumPy learning repository!** 🎉
This repo contains practical notebooks, exercises, and examples as I explore and master the **NumPy library** for numerical computing in Python.

## 📌 About NumPy

**NumPy** (Numerical Python) is the core library for scientific computing in Python.
It provides:

* Powerful **N-dimensional arrays**
* Fast mathematical operations
* Broadcasting for vectorized computation
* Tools for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and more

## 📚 Topics Covered

Here’s a structured list of topics I’ve learned and practiced:

### 🔹 Basics

* Importing NumPy
* NumPy Arrays vs Python Lists
* Array Properties & Attributes (`shape`, `ndim`, `size`, `itemsize`, `dtype`, `astype()`)

### 🔹 Indexing & Iteration

* Indexing & slicing
* Iterating over arrays
* Boolean indexing

### 🔹 Array Operations

* Basic arithmetic operations
* Unary operations
* Universal functions (ufuncs)

### 🔹 Reshaping Arrays

* `ravel()`, `reshape()`, `transpose()`
* Stacking & splitting

### 🔹 Visualization

* Plotting graphs using NumPy + Matplotlib

### 🔹 Advanced

* Broadcasting

## 🎯 Goal

By the end of this learning journey, I aim to:

✅ Be confident in using NumPy arrays for numerical computations
✅ Understand array operations & broadcasting
✅ Build a strong foundation for **Machine Learning & Data Science**
